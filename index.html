        <hr width="80%">
        <div class="description"> 
            Movies aren’t just entertainment for me—they’re an experience.  
            I even use an app to meticulously <strong>categorize</strong> everything I’ve watched,  
            rate them, and pour my thoughts into short (or sometimes long) commentaries.  
        <br><br>
            When it comes to genres, I have a soft spot for <strong>psychological horror</strong>.  
            There’s just something exhilarating about the feeling of being utterly <em>mind-blown</em>  
            by a perfectly executed plot twist. I love that sense of confusion,  
            that moment where everything shifts, leaving me in complete awe.  
        <br><br>
            Another favorite of mine? <strong>Dystopian</strong> films.  
            I’m drawn to their complexity, the way they build futuristic worlds  
            that feel both thrilling and unsettling. The more intricate and thought-provoking,  
            the better—give me something that challenges my perception of reality,  
            and I’m hooked.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have a <strong>yearly tradition</strong> of binge-watching the entire <i>Harry Potter</i> movie series,  
                            and I know for a fact that I will <strong>never get tired of it</strong>.  
                            No matter how many times I rewatch it, the magic always feels just as real.   
                            While watching, I can't help but wish that someday,  
                            I’d wake up to find out that I’m actually a <strong>wizard</strong>,  
                            enrolled at <strong>Hogwarts</strong>, learning spells, brewing potions,  
                            and living in a world filled with magic.   
                            The world of <i>Harry Potter</i> is more than just a story—  
                            it’s an <strong>escape</strong>, a place where anything feels possible,  
                            and a universe I will <strong>always go back to</strong>.

                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my <strong>canon movie</strong>.  
                            I am still <strong>devastated</strong> by the fact that they didn’t end up together.  
                            They finally achieved their dreams, but <strong>without each other</strong>.  
                            They were so <strong>perfect together</strong>, yet some things are just not meant to be.  
                            <br><br>
                            This might as well be the definition of a <strong>perfect movie</strong> for me—  
                            the production, the cinematography, the aesthetic, <strong>everything</strong>.  
                            And of course, the <strong>musical scores</strong>—  
                            they linger in my mind long after the movie ends.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am the <strong>biggest fan</strong> of Studio Ghibli movies, and this is my <strong>top favorite</strong>.  
                            Not just because I share a similar name with the female lead,  
                            but because everything in this movie feels like a <strong>haven</strong> to me.  
                            <br><br>
                            The <strong>odd yet mesmerizing plot</strong>, the unique flow of the story,  
                            and the overall <strong>aesthetic</strong> of this movie make it stand out from anything else I've ever watched.  
                            There’s something so <i>magical</i> about *Howl’s Moving Castle*—  
                            from its breathtaking visuals to its heartwarming themes of love, identity, and freedom.  
                            I could rewatch it a hundred times and still be in awe every single time.

                        </div>
                        <p> 
                            <strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller, Mystery, Horror<br>
                            <strong>Director:</strong> Lee Chung-hyun<br>
                            <strong>Main Cast:</strong> Park Shin-hye, Jeon Jong-seo
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Call is, without a doubt, a <strong>top-tier Korean thriller</strong>.  
                            From start to finish, this movie had me <strong>on edge</strong>,  
                            constantly second-guessing what would happen next.
                            The concept of <strong>time manipulation</strong> in this film is nothing short of brilliant—  
                            the way it intertwines the <strong>past, present, and future</strong> is both <strong>mind-bending</strong> and terrifying.  
                            I love how the story showcases the impact of a single action in the past  
                            and how it can <strong>spiral into catastrophic consequences</strong> in ways that no one can predict.  
                            This movie doesn’t just play with time; it <strong>warps reality itself</strong>,  
                            making me question every possibility and outcome.  
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, if there’s one thing that still frustrates me, it’s <strong>the ending</strong>.  
                            I went through all that tension, suspense, and anxiety, only to be left <strong>shocked and unsatisfied</strong>.  
                            Even now, I find myself thinking about the final moments,  
                            wondering if there was a different way things could have played out.

                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Black Swan is one of those films that left a <strong>lasting impact</strong> on me.  
                            It’s haunting, mesmerizing, and deeply unsettling—a cinematic experience  
                            that pulls you into the <strong>darkest corners of the human psyche</strong>.  
                            At its core, this film is about the <strong>pursuit of perfection</strong>—  
                            a suffocating, obsessive, and ultimately self-destructive journey.  
                            Nina’s descent into madness is both terrifying and tragic,  
                            and Natalie Portman’s performance is nothing short of <strong>extraordinary</strong>.  
                            She captures every nuance of a woman <strong>trapped between expectations and reality</strong>,  
                            constantly torn apart by her own mind and the pressure that surrounds her.  
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This movie perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be a woman—  
                            constantly striving for <strong>unattainable perfection</strong>,  
                            while being shaped and pressured by the environment and the people around you.  
                            Society demands flawlessness, but at what cost?  
                            The film explores themes of identity, obsession, and the devastating effects  
                            of pushing oneself beyond the breaking point.

                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pearl is a <strong>brilliantly twisted</strong> character study that  
                            peels back the layers of a woman on the verge of insanity.  
                            At its core, this movie is about <strong>unfulfilled dreams and suffocating desperation</strong>.  
                            Pearl is a woman who craves the spotlight,  
                            who dreams of escaping her mundane existence and becoming a <strong>star</strong>.  
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This movie is more than just a horror movie—it’s a film about  
                            the <strong>fragile line between ambition and insanity</strong>.  
                            It explores what happens when someone is denied their dream for too long,  
                            when their longing for recognition turns into something dark and violent.  
                            The cinematography, the bright and colorful aesthetic that contrasts  
                            with the horrific themes, and the vintage Hollywood feel  
                            all make this film <strong>uniquely captivating</strong>.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Hunger Games is one of the most <strong>compelling dystopian stories</strong>  
                                ever brought to life on screen.
                                The political undertones in The Hunger Games are <strong>eerily relevant</strong>. 
                                The cinematography and score elevate the intensity of the story.  
                                Every action scene is heart-pounding, every quiet moment filled with raw emotion.  
                                The contrast between the lavish excess of the Capitol and the harsh reality of the districts  
                                is both visually and thematically striking.  
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hunger Games is more than just a dystopian film—it’s a <strong>social commentary</strong>.  
                                It challenges us to question authority, to recognize the dangers of power left unchecked,  
                                and to understand the true cost of war.  
                                This isn’t just about survival in the arena;  
                                it’s about <strong>the resilience of the human spirit</strong>,  
                                the will to fight against injustice, and the power of one person to change the world.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interstellar is hands down one of the most <strong>brilliantly crafted sci-fi films</strong>  
                                ever made. It’s not just another space movie—it’s an <strong>emotional, thought-provoking, and scientifically accurate</strong>  
                                masterpiece that challenges our perception of time, space, and human survival.  
                                I was <strong>completely hooked</strong> from start to finish, but at the same time,  
                                this movie made me feel <strong>completely dumb</strong> at certain points—  
                                because it deals with theories that are far beyond what we can comprehend.  
                 
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But beyond the science, *Interstellar* is deeply personal.  
                                At its core, it’s a <strong>story about love, sacrifice, and time</strong>.  
                                The father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph  
                                is one of the most heartbreaking yet powerful dynamics in the film. 
                                Few films have ever <strong>impacted me this deeply</strong>.  
                                If I could erase my memory and watch it for the first time again, I would.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now *this* is what I’m talking about.  
                                A dystopian movie that had me completely <strong>hooked</strong> from the very beginning.  
                                I still remember the first time watching Maze Runner—  
                                the confusion, the thrill, the non-stop action—  
                                and just being <strong>so immersed</strong> in this chaotic world.  
                                What makes Maze Runner so good is that it doesn’t just throw action at you—  
                                it gives you something to *think* about.  
                                The deeper I got into the story,  
                                the more I realized that escaping the maze wasn’t even the worst part.  
                                The real*horror was what waited beyond it.  
                                WCKD, the experiments, the idea that survival itself is part of a bigger test—  
                                it was so unsettling but also *so addicting*.  
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                                Watching *Maze Runner* made me wish I could experience it for the first time all over again.  
                                The twists, the suspense, the adrenaline rush—it’s exactly 
                                the kind of dystopian story that keeps me coming back for more.  
                                If I ever wake up in a Glade surrounded by a maze, though?  
                                I’d be the first to die. No question.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I’ve said before, I am the *biggest* Studio Ghibli enthusiast,  
                                and Whisper of the Heart holds a very special place in my heart.  
                                This is my second favorite Ghibli film, and honestly, it’s so close to being my first.  
                                There’s just something about this movie that feels like a warm hug—  
                                the youthful energy, the small yet *profound* moments,  
                                and the kind of romance that isn’t just about love,  
                                but about growth, passion, and self-discovery.  
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have always been a huge fan of nostalgic and coming-of-age themes in movies,  
                                and this one delivers it so perfectly.  
                                There’s no dramatic conflict, no over-the-top twists—  
                                just a beautifully simple story about two young people  
                                finding themselves and each other in the midst of life’s uncertainties. 
                                No matter how many times I rewatch it, it still makes me feel the same way—  
                                like I’m young again, dreaming big, and believing that anything is possible.

                                <i>Light Shop</i> was honestly terrifying at first because of its horror elements,  
                                but as the story unraveled, it became something much deeper—  
                                a tale about life, death, and the weight of guilt and regrets.  
                                <br><br>
                                The characters were trapped in the same alley, unable to move forward,  
                                and the Light Shop served as the final decision—whether to continue or not.  
                                I really loved the theme and concept; it was so unique that it got me completely hooked.  
                                <br><br>
                                I watched it all in one sitting, and yet, I’m still devastated that the couple  
                                didn’t recognize each other in the end.

                                <strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy, Adventure, Romance<br>
                                <strong>Director:</strong> Nathan Greno, Byron Howard<br>
                                <strong>Main Cast:</strong> Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi  
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Out of all the Disney princess movies, Tangled is hands down my favorite.  
                                There’s just something so magical about it—  
                                the adventure, the humor, the romance, and of course, the lantern scene.  
                                That scene alone is enough to make this my ultimate favorite.  
                                <br><br>
                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At its core, Tangled is about dreams, love, and freedo*.  
                                It’s about taking that leap of faith,  
                                stepping into the unknown, and realizing that you are more capable than you think.  
                                No matter how many times I rewatch this movie,  
                                it still gives me the same warm, magical feeling.  
                                And every time I see lanterns in the internet,  
                                I can’t help but think of Rapunzel’s dream finally coming true.

                                <strong>Genre:</strong> Thriller, Drama, Dark Comedy<br>

                                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There’s a reason why Parasite is considered one of the greatest films of all time—  
                                and why it easily made the list of my favorite movies.  
                                This film is pure cinematic genius.  
                                Every single detail—the setting, the house, the cinematography,  
                                the way the scenes unfold—everything means something.  
                                What makes Parasite so mind-blowing is its ability to shift tones seamlessly.  
                                It starts as a dark comedy, then turns into an intense thriller.
                                <br><br>
                                And let’s talk about the symbolism.  
                                The film constantly plays with the idea of high and low,  
                                from the literal height difference between the rich and poor homes,  
                                to the way the characters move within the house.   
                                A film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.  
                                It’s a reminder that cinema isn’t just about storytelling,  
                                but about crafting something layered, meaningful, and unforgettable.
